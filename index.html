        <p>I'm a web developer but I do automation testing most of my time. I enjoy traveling and love hiking in serene mountainous places. I like drinking milk tea as you can see in my profile picture, love visiting cafes to try out delicious assorted pastries and always been fascinated with all the various interior design themes. </p>

          <h3>Learning is a lifelong process</h3>
          <p>As technology is evolving rapidly, staying ahead of the game is necessary. I realised there are so much I dont know about the latest technologies. This motivates me to challenge myself to learn and master new skills. The skills that I learned have proven to
            improve the efficiency of my daily tasks. I am currently exploring new skills such as interior designing and learning how to perform a tea ceremony. Learning is a lifelong process that is unavoidable and happens all the time. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a postive attitude to learning both for personal and professional development. </p>

          <h3>Goals & Aspirations</h3>
          <p>I would like to pick up tennis as a sport, it helps to improve metabolism function and improve muscle tone, strength and flexibility which is what I needed the most. I enjoy attending courses with my friends, courses such as pottery making is a lot of fun! You can make your own pottery and bring them back for your home decor! ^_^
             Together with my wife, we are picking up a small collection of indoor plants. These houseplants help lower our stress and improve our moods. (It's proven! :D) My next goal is to successfully grow an orchid indoor.
